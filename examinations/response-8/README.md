> The danger here is that when compounding isn’t intuitive we often ignore its potential and focus on solving problems through other means. Not because we’re overthinking, but because we rarely stop to consider compounding potential.
> None of the 2,000 books picking apart Buffett’s success are titled _This Guy Has Been Investing Consistently for Three-Quarters of a Century_. But we know that’s the key to the majority of his success. It’s just hard to wrap your head around that math because it’s not intuitive.

# Findings


## MSF Items







B. Maintenance of Master Securityholder File

Rule 17Ad-10(a)(1) under the Exchange Act states that every recordkeeping transfer agent shall promptly and accurately post to the master securityholder file debit and credits containing minimumand appropriate certificate detail representing every security transferred, purchased, redeemed orissued[^1]

[^1]: can do a good usbsection here with IL and cede setup]


Rule 17Ad-10(b) under the Exchange Act states that every recordkeeping transfer agent shall maintain and keep current an accurate master securityholder file and subsidiary files. If such transferagent has any record difference, its master securityholder file and subsidiary files must accuratelyrepresent all relevant debits and credits until the record differences is resolved. The recordkeeping transfer agent shall exercise diligent and continuous attention to resolve all record differences.

The Staff discovered the following exceptions during its review of the Laylor Corporation (“Laylor”) master securityholder file for the period of September 2023 through April 2025:


1. First Last (“Investor A”): In an email dated September 28, 2023, Laylor’s President, authorized the issuance of 100,000 shares to Investor A. While some of the certificate detail required under Rule 17Ad-9(a)(2) and (5) under the Exchange Act appears in the Legacy Database, as evidenced in the excel spreadsheet of its output, BlockTrans did not post the credit of 100,000 shares to the blockchain portion of the Master Securityholder File (“MSF”) for the issuance to this securityholder.

Pursuant to Rule 17Ad-10(a)(2)(i) under the Exchange Act, recordkeeping transfer agentsmust post credits containing minimum and appropriate certificate detail within 30 days after issuance. As the authorization for the issuance of Investor A’s shares is dated September 28, 2023, BlockTrans should have posted the credit of 100,000 shares to the MSF by October 28, 2023.

In addition, the Staff’s review of the information maintained on the Legacy Database for Investor A disclosed that the data populating the “from” column (column J) reflected the Memo (HASH) from the transaction issuing another investor’s 300,000 shares. As a result, it appears that this data was mistakenly linked to Investor A’s certificate detail.[^2]

[^2]: subsubsection with start of issue auth convo...]
for excel _See_ TAR n.45


2. First Last (“Investor B”): This securityholder’s 1 million shares were revoked/cancelled on December 8, 2023, as a result of the clawback by the issuer. The shares were subsequently re-issued to Investor B pursuant to an email authorization from Laylor to BlockTrans on February 26, 2024. However, the Staff’s review of the information maintained on the Legacy Database for Investor B disclosed that the issue date (“aqAt”), reflected in “holdings” column (column k) corresponded to the original establishment of the cancelled position on September 11, 2023, not February 26, 2024 (authorization date) or March 21, 2024 (date of transaction on the Stellar blockchain)[^3]

[^3]: DB design and good catch on the blockchain side..]




Therefore, BlockTrans is not in compliance with Rule 17Ad-10(a) under the Exchange Act for failing to post the credit of 100,000 shares to the blockchain for the issuance to Investor A within the 30-day time frame, as well as for posting inaccurate certificate detail to the MSF for both Investors A and B.

Moreover, BlockTrans is not in compliance with Rule 17Ad-10(b) under the Exchange Act sincethese discrepancies caused BlockTrans’s MSF for Laylor to be inaccurate during the period of September 2023 through April 2025.


## control book items

C. Maintenance of Control Book

Rule 17Ad-10(e) under the Exchange Act states that every recordkeeping transfer agent shallmaintain and keep current an accurate control book for each issue of securities. A change in the control book shall not be made except upon written authorization from a duly authorized agent of the issuer. Rule 17Ad-9(d) under the Exchange Act defines a control book as a record or other document that shows the total number of shares authorized and issued by the issuer.

As noted above, the issuer's email of September 28, 2023, authorized the issuance of 100,000 shares to Investor A. The Registrant’s failure to post a credit for these shares to the blockchain portion of  the MSF resulted in understatement of Laylor’s issued share amount by 100,000 shares. Consequently, Laylor’s issued amount reflected on its Control Book was understated by 100,000 shares during the period of October 2023 through April 2025.

Therefore, BlockTrans is not in compliance with Rule 17Ad-10(e) under the Exchange Act for failing to maintain and keep current an accurate control book for Laylor.













##  §2 Internal and Proceduaral Weaknesses

###  Client Identity Verification Procewss

Hadnnking kYC inforation has alwyas been the msot centralized function  I envisioned  for thee SYndicate. It  rleated deepl yto   my aspireaitons in Response 5 note 7  to disintermediate wall Street, because o f a  principle I commonly ccite  called Conway's Law. The rule[^conway=paper]  originateds from a paper on  the innonvative capacity  of committees, w hich I've seen repeatedly fail to ourperform independnet  moeny managers  given the leeway to allocate capital as  they see fit within their own small groups. Put more applcicably, all  my investing  epxerience sccreaams  to  me that  small  teams are the m ost e fficient deployment  of resources, adn as such I've designed all possible posilicies to  support  decentralized  autonomous  teams  of orgnaization memebrs without explicit directive  overhead  or managemnet.

The cchallenge and opporuntiy with KYC lies in the intimate bonding requirements to  proccess PII. Even in the legacy  OPpersona implementation, internal team members needed  to login and authentiaccakte identieis. Thiss processing reality conflicts with my visioon for peromsisioneless working arrangments wheere contributors have  a minnmumal set of sensitive permissions, electing to work on any public repos.

My  intial rememdy was  to outsource this to a proprietary development company abcked by the  titans of Sand Hill. This worked fine while the Syndicate waas still copletely centralized priorr to discovereing the communtiy. But no that we are migrating to open standdards together, a central service provider for such a crucial part of investor onboarding threatens the envisioned open team concepts I hold s odearly

The Deficincy  Letter cites our disconitnued  use of the legacy rpovidor partluy  due to ccosts of the service. While this was a factor,  money  is  not particiuualy  an  item in my  mind when it  comes ot  investor ptoections.[^sel-psn] The bigger problem I s ee comeds from the internalization of ercnomies of scale and platform netowrk effects withihn a poor copoate govenrance framwrok, as happeneed to DTCC [^mercy]


[^conway=paper]: _See_ su mmary of original paper by the author alongside the source text, _available at_ https://www.melconway.com/Home/Conways_Law.html. To the briefest extent possible, Conway proposes what I have seen so intimately trading nascent ccrypto markets  in comparison  to entranches futuers derivatives. These are two extrrmes  of a  spectrum defined  by  insitutional adoptiona and entranching regulation, r and the movement  of these assets in the fre market  deeply  reflects that . Watching price action subtly change after  the introdfuction  of CME  bitcoin futures really showed me that the thought behind market  strucutre changes ccan have downstream impliccations for ddecades to  come, legitimatley  shaping  society


[^sel-psn]: as cited  in earlier  work inclduding primative grant applications not ccommunciated, Persona  as i udnerstand it is one of the m ost expensive iddentity  vverification services  avaliable.  I selected  to after extensive diligence into yst about every  reputable identiity  provicer. and even primative  prototype implementtions used alternatives such as Blokcpass ti test onboarding flows. I foundd that the stramlines user interface and edirect document secuyrity features of  the Persona platform far exceeded competing offerings, and so i ppiicked  it as the best possible existing solution to start

Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Policy – BlockTrans’s AML Policy reflects the use ofthe Persona platform in its Client Identity Verification process. BlockTrans currentlydocuments its verification process by adding an internal reference to the Persona account number (the “PSNA Reference”) within the securityholder’s Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”). However, BlockTrans ceased using Persona during 2025 because of limitations of the screening application and costs of the service.

 Therefore, BlockTrans should update its AML Policy to reflect its new process for performing and documenting client identity verification

## OFAC Searches

C. U.S. Department of Treasury – Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) –

BlockTrans Does Not Maintain or Implement Written Procedures Related to Its OFAC Searches

_thye shoiuyd reach  out  dir_

Every person or business in the U.S., including all securities transfer agents, must monitor transactions to blocked countries, and to certain identified individuals, by comparing and matching information against current lists (www.treas.gov/ofac) maintained by OFAC.

The Staff’s review of BlockTrans’s procedures revealed that the Registrant does not address OFAC compliance. However, the Registrant verbally disclosed that it utilized the Persona platform for screening against OFAC’s list of specially designated nationals (“SDNs”), which was evidenced by adding a PSNA Reference within the securityholder’s PII. However, the Staff’s review of the output from the Legacy Database disclosed two securityholders, Investors C and D, whose PII did not include a PSNA Reference, indicating they had not been screened.
Further, based on the Staff’s conversations with BlockTrans, it appears that these screenings were performed only at the time a securityholder was onboarded, rather than periodically which would be more prudent for a dynamic list like OFAC’s SDNs.

Therefore, BlockTrans’ failure to maintain written procedures addressing OFAC regulations, and to conduct OFAC searches for these two securityholders is an internal control weakness.

BlockTrans could consult OFAC’s website at http://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/office-of-foreign-assets-control-sanctions-programs-and-information to review its obligations underOFAC’s mandate and make any changes deemed by the Firm to be necessary for compliance.

### Lost Securityholder Search Evidence

The Staff’s review of BlockTrans’s Unresponsive orLost User Policy disclosed that it does not require BlockTrans to maintain evidence of the specific search terms, search results, or screenshots/summaries of reports generated by
the search engines used. As a result, BlockTrans did not maintain such documentation.

Consequently, BlockTrans’s written procedures did not appear to be adequately designed to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of the Rule. During the examination, the Registrant took steps to update its written procedures for Unresponsive or Lost User to incorporate requirements to document each search with comprehensive screenshots orgenerated reports that include the search date, search terms, and U.S. - based personal
identifiers

### Handling MailSecurities) 

The Staff’s discussions with BlockTrans disclosed that it currently uses PhysicalAddress for receipt and handling of its mail. PhysicalAddress scans envelopes received at the 99 Wall Street address for the Registrant and posts them on its platform for review by BlockTrans. The Registrant will then instruct PhysicalAddress on how to handle the item (i.e., forward, open/scan to pdf, or shred). However, BlockTrans has not established written procedures to define what category/type of mail should receive which treatment.

Rule 17Ad-12(a) under the Exchange Act states that any registered transfer agent that hascustody or possession of any funds or securities related to its transfer agent activities shall assure that (1) all such securities are held in safekeeping and handled, in light of all facts and circumstances, in a manner reasonably free from risk of theft, loss or destruction. As noted above, securityholders had been instructed to mail physical stock certificates to BlockTrans.


Although the Registrant has not received any physical certificates at the 99 Wall Street address, BlockTrans’ failure to have a documented methodology for handling different categories/types of mail received at a virtual business address appears to be an internal control weakness.

#### Extendign Safeguarding  Interpretive proxy

Firstr o f all,  I would like to commend the Commission for bringing transfer agentr regualtions back onto the proposed-rule  stage earlier this moonth.[^rin] I partiucally appreciate how this is the only one of  23  agency  rules with an regualtory classification under E.O. 14192. If I might say so, transfer agents offer the perfect outdated regulatory regime to update with the leeway given  by any defregulations.

NAmely, in jsut a few monhtss we'll reach the ten-year annivaersary of staff  contemplations of TA market structure in S7-27-15.  In this time, the monoply  concerns raised about DTCC  have only strengthened as  they  rollout an industry-encompassing[^totla-ccontrol] ssystem  designed  to encompass all U.S. assets.[^pprev-psure] Unlike other Proposed urlemaking, 3235-AL55 has a single congressional authority.[^dtmnd]

I  find this single public-policy  rrpecedence Judiciously relevant  on  the basis of limited past TA operational controls , especialyl  those droppped from June 12th's "regulatyr reset."[^rr-osc] fro time, I'll elaborate on two of  the policy choices impliccated in meeting remarks over ta ijtnenral protections. In contemplating these ideas, I have  to  ask myself, :"might clear, public rules on GitHub Solicit trust?"

[^totla-ccontrol]: I commented extensively on the horendous unilateral authority implicit in the design of DTCC Digital Assets ("DA"), _available at_ https://lnns.co/O8NUZfc1KGe. _See also_ blog post published the day Dave reahed out to begin the  examination process, subtitled with  a  critiqe  on "keeping control centralized" in whaat the title purports is aa master plan for unchecked power, _available at_ https://genfinity.io/2025/04/30/dtcc-on-chain-patent-global-finance-takeover.  THe author repsondds to a patent application from DTCC which substantially mimics my own, albeit with mucch less public transprency. Should we really alow complex widespread rollout for dozens of untested proprietary conteracts without a mucch as even an Advanced Notice?

[^pprev-psure]: _See_ DA's  encompasssing grasp opn financial  instutions and investable  assets  in the TAR letter at § II.D.1 ¶¶ 8, 13, and 16–18. Should we  contnue handing American savings andd retirments i nto the opaque custody of an  entity which is alreaddy  too big to fail ? Suuch view was explicitly  eloquated by the author of the patent in coprated by refernce in  _Id._ _See, e.g,_ substantiated professionals supporting critiqes of singular custody nomiinees with both industry and academic evidence  pointing to yet anther  public bailout in TAR letter nn. 51, 106, and 143–145.


[^dtmnd]: At  least  for  proposed items with a defined legal authortity  from _supra_ note {{^rin}}, with one important safe-harbor  consideration citing basis in 57 rules. _See also_ the specific trasnsf-eragnet  item, _available at_ https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=202504&RIN=3235-AL55. With legislative standing frp,m the NMS Statute, might  we have a  greater burnedon of investigation than standard notice and commenting? Again, subparagraph (f)(2)(A)(ii) spells out hte need  for enhanced FAC review "in the absence of a uniform rule" for saafety.;



[^rr-osc]: This has b een one colloquial refernce  ot the 14 dropped rule changes within online p rofessional circles, refering the derefulatory staff actions at, _available at_ https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/final/2025/33-11377.pdf. _See also generally_ Commissioner Atkin's remarks  that this _is_ (*emphasis orginally thoughp9tu publications) a new day at the agency, wwhich is  great. I'll keep this citation short to keep focus  on  the direct  action changes above,  which  stouched some very significant policy items from the klast  Administration. Extraordinary  cmmitment to free markets.





###### SCI and Cybersecutity Protections

When I toured Geoprgia Tech in high school, thje student guide made  great efforts  to point out hte Klaus Advanced Computing Building, one of the  more striking buildigs o n ccampuswhere I  attended  many graduate  cryptogrpahy classes.  chris Klaus also happened to  be a  leading donor proponent of CREATE-X,  the  euntrperneeur incubation and promotion program discussed in our first two meetings.[^createx] The guidde tol us about how Klaus dropped out to persue his cybersecurity  startup, which sold  to IBM for over $2,000,000,000.[^inflation]

In my  early-action appliation top Tech, I explicitly mentioned the program in terms of my first blockchain startup, mMMonerAds.[^man-relevance] Uponadmission , i applied  to the submmer  profram freshman year. However, I was told after pitching a penale on my ideas that I could not joing wihtout a cofounder.

This began years of wresting with otheer peoples' vision  for how I should run a transgfer agency,[^notad]  since  "most  startups fail without a cofounder."[^apprx]  Whiel I apprecciate thos entiments, I found the discipline to  patiently wait for the right opportunity in  the unforgiving Indifferencce of market quiet. This approach paidd off four  yeras later when I encountered the excpetional partner cited in PREV  § III.

ONe year after m ,eeting Jerry in _supra_ note {{notad}}, he began teaching graduate cyberseucrty  classes. They introduced me  to the  immense centralized  risks  of concerntring market PII and MNPI ,[^intro-frens] exmeplified  in Ex . 8.8,  a report  on the Equifax data breach. Throughout the semester, we'd walk after lecturees disucssing market  structure and contemplateions on ssecuring a self-custody blockchain TAD.


[^createx]: THe program itemslf acted as a typical startup  incubator  with experienced  indsutry mentors. To  the  extent it relates  to t his Exma,  it  included the oipportunity to contnually  pitch investors. While  I alwyas new  the  shares would need to reside in a nonprofit, I played along with these charades. This experiinec gave me respect  for small-business cpaital formatioon, as Donna commented on July 15th.


[^inflation]: Inn 2025  dollars.


[^man-relevance]: I cited these years ofexperience in our first meeting as background for the remote-dirst organizatioonal design which I understand to  best efficiently  orgnazie a free-software working community.  I find relevant  the publis Secretarof-of-State filings ;'s privacy reldactions and inclusions, _available at_ https://www.sosnc.gov/online_services/search/Business_Registration_profile/14324280. North  Caolrina follows's the  commission's policy of censoring emails while publishing full physical addresses and  phgone numbers. However, I disagree with their requirmenet of a "principal opffice" which was my parent's house asnd, in the Articles  avaliable under "View  Filings"  with No. C201815700063, the fmaily  residence of a friend.

[^notad]: Nobody understood what a TAD was, and  it was too  mcuh  effort with the scarse public documentation back  then  to  satisfactory  convince them of  the need  for such  a new  system. Namely, I was  bafflingly unfamiliar with the TAR letter'ss PCO event, despite an explicit suprise reference thereto in a school pitch competition touted by the tour  guide which immedeiatyley  intreuiged me, _available at_ https://youtu.be/S75IvkicWD8. THe m onths of pitching prepration for this show introduced me to valuable earl yonnections, many o f whom are in the exmaple shareholder ledger prop, _available at_ https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FgBoJeKZ_EPy8Dlwd4dARyRCniqcET0VR1IDkrx4kKY/pub. one  paritcualtlryu relevant judge fdrom  early  pitch-practice and  application sessions was Jerry {Perullo, the ICE CISO for two decaddes quotesd  in  the EDGAR comment at 21.

[^apprx]: Approximate paraphrase  of  the repeated statistics I heard regaurding  failed solo foudners.  Ex. 8.7 is a reponse to this critique drafted at the end of 2019 and submitted to the comittee early  in 2020 to finalize my rejected iingagural application. This ultimately let me move on from a venture which  was frnakly harmful to the environment and consumer technology, as I had practically came  to recognize  mby the later stages of the  applciatin process.  THerafter, I published my thesxis and, within a year pushign through COVId hardships, incorpoated the early-fform Registrant. 



[^intro-frens]: These two  fdeadly  acronyms have  been tmy  top concenrns  in open0-sourcing  Syndicate  ifnrastructure  over the last years. I  found  in early  development  efforts  details  _infra_ § {{TODO:team section number}}  that it can be challenging  to  extensively test interface deplyoments without established and volumnous sample data.  This is why  I issued  teh DEMO asset from the Syndicate's mainnet account, facilitating early code sprints.  I plan to overccome this  challenge  with  future  testneet integrations and faker users.


###### Exchange Software LIcenccing Decision

The reform  agenda  changes dropped rulemaking propsing new cyberseucity o versights  for trasnfer agents and an expansion of Regulation SCI to  systemic infrastrucure in clduing swaps dat arepositories. LArge b rokers (including those rtunning an ATS) and the uncovered clearing agencies are the backbone of markets, making up the critical NSCC participant-base.  Staff identied  this and sought to  regulate awayt risks.

> [C]losed-source software is just awful, riddled with bugs. It would not stand a day if it was open and bug-bountied, but it has the advantage that no one's looking. And I'm saying that because, if it's open-source, people find the bugs immediately, and people even fix the bugs immediately and it moves a lot faster.

IO share this uqote  from Jerry[^aadversarial] befcause I eblievve wholehearely that we can achieve the due andnecccesary increased cyber protections Americans more effiociently wirh the  poen-soyece principles shared regaiirding  an  investor identity verification software. I  have adopted these working principles in all that  I do, as shown for  exmaple  by  the crafting of this entire response on Github, _available at_ https://github.com/blocktransfer/SEC-publications. Might a recognition of this  differentiate working path help us preventn catastrophies like the eight0figure Russian MNPI hack fromm EDGAR  letter  § B.1.a?


<img width="600" alt="exchange-types" src="imgs/software-license.png">

What I'm getting at has been deeply intertwiend with my Examnication resposnes since citing community sentiments in Resposnse  3  note  11. It's a decisiokn  to decentralize  control  and economic benefit from a select  corporation or association  of intermediates,  in  gfavcor  to investor quality. We gface a  paramount decision as  to  the  Commission's  immediate  resposne  to DA's "tokenized  securtities,"  dframed within out circles[^bob-meme]  as very distinct paths for investors and the future of law.





[^aadversarial]: _See_ rountbale disussion withh vwterab ccybersecurity executivies acting in c-suite roles largely  involved  in financial  services  or  data lakes, _available at_ https://adversarial.com/blog/the-adversarial-podcast-ep-8-pagers-and-supply-chain-attacks-github-stealers-founder-mode.  At 48:21, Jerry  summarizes  a shared, agreed perspective  that open  tools have historically  proved  more reseliant,  secure, and trusted than the proprioetary infrastructe  of central actors presently  encompassed  by enhanced Commission tehcnological oversight.   I;ve shared the podcast with technically-inclined community memebrs as great  permissionless education . We can do it.

[^bob-meme]: _See_ bottom image comparing finanical infrastructure  to  railroad  tracks, with DTCC on a very different path than certain public blokchain syustems which inmpklcitly  facilitate peer-to-peer trade through a layer-one decentralized protocol.  THe  posts responds to reamrks regarding the funciton of markets to serve socierty  by driving innovation and  prosperioty, a key  objective of all  my  work  given the tendancy fo public  companies running exchanges to prioritize theri bhistghest-frequency customers, who have the least to do with the efficient formation of capital supporting the rise of business and employment for masses of Americans.  WE can't let Wall Street dictate  our lives because their forefathers  laid yesteryear's iron tracks. What if we all had equal access to the market for capital at a local level?





###### Proprietary Verses Individual Custody

Durngt he summer we registed withthe Commission, Klaus and their team told us about their experiences and cpitall. After denying a n offer to invest in the FFirm, klaus explained an enterprise internet-sale  to NASA. The company convinced the agency to purchase their cyberpseccurityy spftware/, and Klaus was just about to walk into the closing room to snegotiating a gee to outfit protection on all their computers.

Given the novelty  of port protection in the early 2000s., A mentor told him to ask for ten times whatever he would charge. i see our markets in a simialr sstate today, where the backend systems can extract as much rent as spreads statutoritly  allow. with no alternative  ott he leveraged central clearing rail, investors must give  up direct ownership no matterr the  cosst just to trade atall

We onyl  had so muh past technology to deal with The flaws of central  closed instuttiional registration.[^paperowrk-crisis] As society  forced costs down  through  infrastrucutre innovation, we unntentionaly centralized legal registers into a single electronc record, akin to a select compoerx service vendor.[^mom-fidl] But today Wall Street sells a product trivially replced by  distriubtedlrdgers for free.

NASA paid th e xorbitatnt rate because there weren't modern decentralized open0sourced  solutions  putting everyone on the same playing field, just as most investors  hadnd untold billions into plumbing enabled by indirect beneficial ownership. In reflectig on CISO reference materials and observation of managed cyber platforms'  growht,[^awscollege] I've concluded the most efficent  systems allows the flexability of decen talized  open  implementaions  with imrpovements  returned to the shared project l.[^agpl-setns] I want to bring this decentralized  self-custod y  ethos  from  indepndent code ownership into the market with a DEX.




[^paperowrk-crisis]: _See_ study  commintcated from the  Commission  to Congress  two  years before DTC's formation, examinging ddecades-long  sturcutral changes  to teh capital markets, _available at_ https://www.sechistorical.org/collection/papers/1970/1971_0310_SECInstitutionalInvestor_01.pdf. Extensive staff research  form Chapter I to II find insitutional ownership soared as concentrated custodians "ncreased their share of total stock outstanding from less than 7 percent to approximately 19 percent" in  the lead-ip to the Paperwork Crisis. This coincides with Commission  requests for the dominant exchasnge relinquishing mandated trading fees at 9, bringing  free-market cost  to  block trades for the first  time  since the brokers' 1972 oligopoly agreement. Do we have enough mass-market participants again?


[^mom-fidl]: For isntnace,  my Mom held dirctly-regfistered hares of Merk for ddecades, participating in their dividend reinvestment Plan. Reviewing TA statemments  for her position revealed histoirc  fees in lei of compounding investments which inspired early contrmplations on investor pricing, _available at_ https://github.com/JFWooten4/DRIP-fee-impact. Hisotriccally, even these costly  charges uncdercut top brokkerage rates; but, as staff know,, competative changes mmoved the industry  to profits from custody, routing, and lending. This grab for all possibvle ccollateral led my Mom's broker to call her requesting she deposit  her share swith them for "safekeeping and consolidation" in  a single account without legal control in insolvency, as freely  admitted by CCP proponents when testifieying on   perfected interests.


[^awscollege]: _See, e.g.,_ disucssion over proporietary  security  services diuscoivered  through AWS startup program offering a central hosting solution akin  to contituent  software polatforms,, _available at_ https://zopen.to/K8CAHO5DfzKCt1eNINvS. Thisa devleopkemtn approach moimics initial staff impresions of TAD3 from the  first meeting, which  I understand as consistentg of a system deployed complemtelt yu over a service provider with control of data/. As we see with questionable  FTD data  rom the TAR  letter  nn. 11,  34–35, and text aqaccompnaying 32; such ce tralizty  rarely wokrs in the long-run. Even Jerry replies with enohgh caution to "definitely steer clear so there is no chance they think I grabbed their idea" given the natural uneccesary copetition between similar fundmanetal established ingrastructure.


[^agpl-setns]: This is precisely  what I've  been  getting at with  the relentless  citation a nd use  of the Affero GPL, an established standard  for  interoprerable dervitive  software system improvmenets. It  takes what might  start  as  a  centralized p roejct  and allows the communtiy  to  expand  funcitonality  bgasedo mn their own pproved needs as  they use a  system. After deep exokoiration of distirbuted projects for months leading up to  PREV n.20 link 1,a timeline communicated in our first meeting, I came ot the conclusion  that this licensing  approach  may  well be the o ly means  to maintain shared infrastructure  for decades with  the public trasnprency enccerasry for market functiojnality. At least without the token incentives  of cryptonetworks iwth  consensus mechisms  which have all total value sa systemic insurance.



###### Alternate Trading Venue Problemsd


Lastly, the dropped rulemaking dismissed the 2022 amendments to the definition of an exchange, as was so famously subject to comment by the crypto industry.[^Peirce] I care  most intimately about the qualiryt of excchange infrasture in the public  markets, bassed on the immense transaction costs Wall Street's taken from me and my mfamily over and over again.[^enda-sewlf] While such a large market-structure change should not be tucked away in a proposal for Treasuries, the fact remains that proponents of central exchanges can view some blockchain systems as silos of liquidity devoid of protection  given inagural implementations which skirted the line between centrally-cntrolled d unregulated exchanges.[^venue-prot] 

In years of exploration into ATS regulations, history, and operations, much of my interpretation came from a brief email exchange with Anthony Weeresinghe about one year before the Commission brought action against Ustocktrade. In just a brief rejection of bona fide help to our college Design team, thousands of pages of legislative history crystallized into my view understanding these broker-dealers as relentlessly self-interested firms with profits solely derived through intermediating trade.[^fine-fn] Comparatively, my constituents use blockchain market-makers for exemplary fraud investigations using nothing more than block explorers thanks to the public transparency afforded by distributed ledgers using legitimate consensus, a form of indepdenndet decentralized stability not afforded to shahreolders transsacting on central servers.


I prefer public blockchains which, in their own continuing operations, prove themselves as secure with no need for central attestation based on proprietary principles, as adopted in an ecosystem mantra that Bitcoin is the world's largest bug bounty since any vulnerabilities can make you a fortune. As laid out in the TAR letter n.149, I've seen  this ethods direcltry imrpove our own udnerslying infrastrucure, and I I kknow that we  cna  get the rollout o DDEXes right  over time. That's why I''m so concerned over the hastley rollout of DA without due consideration of  its real market-structure and stability risls.

ASs  laid out in the TAR letter § II.B, DA prposes for the irst time to lower trading  costs byh interleaving margin between participants' CCP accounts. Regarless of trading  venue employed, my  interpertation of the SRO rule changes to date reads  that the industry will afford huge implmentation leeway  to the already-mighty DTCC. Any mishandling has been scoped  as catostophic by Commissioner Peirce in TAR  letter n.21, todo

given ii.b.1



[^enda-sewlf]: I na  last-ditch effort ot buy part of Block Transfr at the end of the program "demo day," Klaus directly ogfered "any help I may need" under the clear and later-verified implication of direcyt economic benefit, a tradeoff I find unnaceptable vassed  on perosnal sentiments well explained in TAR letter n.175  en t oto. He miught have gotten exactly what he asked NASA fr given  a lack of alternatives, just as  brokers hold  unchallenged keys to  access the legacy exchange infrastrure build on centrlized, closed custody chains. But I do not believe  arjkets need profit-seeking intermediaries that squeeze every possible micro-cent  out of cxollective sacings and retirments. I ssee outr best opporuntiy  for sustainable efficient markets in nonprofit infrastrue designed with investor priotections and capital formation abovve and beyond limited c04[porate shareholder-value  interests, becuase certain natural monpoiplies just  don't intergrate well with default capitalist cgovenrnace  with so mucch at stake.

[^fine-fn]:  _See_ suit  intiaed by the  cCommission  after the treading platform ceased operations and withdrew registration  at ¶  13 of the settled ccase, _available at_ https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2023/comp25799.pdf. My outreach  wqas within a month of October based on memory, placing  it almost  exactly around  the  collapse of the trading firm. Despite thiss abject failure , the founder requested $1,000  from our student  group just to chat about running a purportedly retail-first  and charitable  venue.  I've found that the exchcange managers use witheld information asx  their  chiegf  tool for m isguidding public interest  ffrom the nature  of their central control, as exemplified _infra_ note {{TODO or  supra  lol.... the WSHYDRS At VEGAS discussion}}  earleier this year in a lunchtime chat with a  data sales e xxecutive  at the  LSE who kept tight-lipped on clikentelle, communciations, and  form in b usinesss preactives to the point htat  I honeslt ygot a headache speaking with their colegeuees.

[^Peirce]: _See_ orginal dissenting statment from Commissioner Peirce disdaining "an expansion in the definition of exchange that would apply to any trading venue, including so-called communication protocol systems, for any type of security,"
, _available at_  https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-ats-20220126. The removal of this  consideration had indsutry-chaneging agfferts for  the tntity  incorpated in the TAR letter n.119's cacccoimnoapy h text, which I brou ght up in our third meeting as a current context  for discussion  of DEX  regualtory principles. THe Staff did an exccellent job guiding my thoughts,,m  notivated by expriences i n the seccond footnote  link,  motre thorougly ddisused  with the  community on out pofact, _available at_ https://lnns.co/rswev9D3A1n/4848. I sincerely  apprecaite d Commissioner  Peirce's hihglihgt  of EtherDelta's settled enforcment  action in menaingful  public forum as a great  exanoke if tghe needed  differentiation between on-chain transparenct orderbooks and proprietary private servers
, _available at_ https://youtu.be/kl7omhTtERE?t=1427.

[^venue-prot]: For isntnace,  the  intemreidairt  incorpated by reference at _Id._ link 2 used a server-based software messaging playtfomr based on a central  cop[mpany, _available at_ https://github.com/airswap/airswap-protocols. Even  open-source solutions like this have layers of  centralizaiton built in when they  rely  on supplemental  consensus mechanismms or   a centrall off-chain  matching servers,  including when a smart  contracts execute on a propriteryt firm-based ledger.  I 've epxlored  this in  Response  6  § 0.B and a wide wswath  of public  work, because i  view  the implications as allowsding automated debited clearing  without a central conuterparty when usinga shared orderbook and matching engine. There doews not exist legal preeccedent for tgese disintermediated structures, despite the plethora of benefits  they  provide investors when done properly.

### Physical  Securities and Lifeccycle

https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/240.17Ad-19

##### Cancellation and Destruction of Securities Certificates

BlockTrans does not currently have written procedures pertaining to the cancellation and/or destruction of securities certificates. Rule 17Ad-19(b) under the Exchange Act requires every transfer agent involved in the handling, processing, or storage of securities certificates to establish and implement written procedures for the cancellation, storage, transportation, destruction, or other disposition of securities certificate. While the Registrant’s business model focuses on uncertificated shares, the Agreement for Transfer Services between BlockTrans and Laylor, dated June 30, 2023, instructed investors to mail prior physical stock certificates to BlockTrans for destruction. Even though BlockTrans did not receive any securities certificates during the Staff’s review period, it should establish written procedures for the cancellation and/or destruction of securities certificates in accordance with the Rule in the event that it does receive them. 





### Securities  Cancellation Dates

This information is required as part of the minimum certificate detail pursuant to Rule 17Ad-9(a) under the Exchange Act. Cancellation dates are reflected on the Stellar blockchain and for securityholders who opened Accounts/Wallets on Stellar (the “Stellar Accounts”) are readily obtainable. However, for those securityholders without Stellar Accounts whose shares are held in the “Distribution Account”, there is no clear audit trail that records the number of shares cancelled by securityholder or the date of cancellation. To obtain this information on a securityholder level, BlockTrans would have to review several sources to determine the number of shares cancelled and the cancel date.

As a result, BlockTrans does not maintain or have readily accessible the cancellation dates or share amounts for cancelled securities of securityholders allocating to the Distribution Account.


### Deleted Certificate Detail

#### backups in CRON and pen...

For those securityholders who don’t maintain StellarAccounts, the Registrant will manually delete certificate detail for cancelled securities. At present, deleted certificate detail for these securityholders would be reflected in backup files maintained by BlockTrans. However, the Registrant does not have a process to back-up and maintain the certificate detail for these securityholders which resides in the Legacy Database.

Rule 17Ad-10(f) under the Exchange Act states that every recordkeeping transfer agentshall retain a record of all certificate detail deleted from the master securityholder file for a period of six years from the date of deletion. In lieu of maintaining a hard copy, a recordkeeping transfer agent may comply with this paragraph by complying with §240.17Ad-7(f) or §240.17Ad-7(g).

BlockTrans’ failure to establish a process to ensure that back-up files of the Legacy Database are maintained is an internal control weakness, as such process could ensure that BlockTrans maintains a record of certificate detail deleted from the MSF as required by Rule 17Ad-10(f) under the Exchange Act.

The Staff’s discussions with the Registrant revealed that the 99 Wall Street address is the location of a virtual business addressservice, PhysicalAddress.com (“PhysicalAddress”), that receives/handles mail for clients.

BlockTrans does not maintain any personnel at that location. Likewise, it does not appear that BlockTrans performs any transfer agent activities at that location.

"far be it _fo me_ to guess at internal _agency_ processings," but it ttook  the Commission over three times  asd long to process this TA/1  as did  the 2023  update referenced in the  Defficicicny letter.f


### TA-1 Principe Office Address

I started blockc Tranfer to address clear problems present in legacy market infrastrucre. We disuccssed exeicig nfair exhangefees, and reforaocats have doumete structural flaws for ecades. Central control created tshse problems as clearing and esettlemnt developed inot the pyramid of middlemne weknow 

I appreciate that teh Commission's used to aplying its laws to centralized organizaaions with principal ffices and hierarchal organiztion reporting. But i beliecve many of these legacy tools liit brilliant contribots' abiltiy to make the best local decisions. And morenlie quality requires tranpsrency
"senior policy making authority"

> The problem of ‘too central to fail’ can be addressed
by reorganizing the underlying network topologies, while the problem of ‘too large to fail’ remains, at least
to a certain extent. It is reasonable to conclude that for systemic risk-efficient allocations (i.e. the optimized
networks) the individual systemic risk becomes more proportional to liabilities
